Bitcoin is very popular among investors due to its market potential. However, predicting its price is a challenging task due to the volatile nature .The aim of this paper is to predict the price change in Bitcoin using various sentiment scores obtained from tweets related to Bitcoin. We use multiple Linear Regression Models using Spark MLlib as well as LSTM and bidirectional LSTM using Tensorflow Keras for prediction. We also look out for the most influential sentiment scores for predicting the price change.
